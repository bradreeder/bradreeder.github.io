        <h2>shamanic distance healing</h2>
        <div className="content-background-colour">
          <p className="padding-top-40px service-text">In my experience healing is only limited by the imagination and you can expect the same benefits and effects over distance as an in-person healing.</p>
          <p className="service-text">After agreeing a time and an intention for what you would like help with, you would be asked to lie down and rest or meditate from a quiet location. I will then tune-in to you remotely from my altar (pictured) to conduct the healing (only your name, picture, and location is needed). This usually involves a combination of:</p>
          <ul className="no-margin-bottom">
            <li>Energy healing</li>
            <li>Elemental healing</li>
            <li>Healing prayers, songs (icaros), and/or chants</li>
            <li>Chakra cleansing & activation</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="service-text">The healing will normally last 30-40 minutes followed by 15 minutes for integration and for us to discuss what we both observed.</p>
            <div className="case-study-img-container">
              <img className="padding-top-40px padding-bottom-80px" src="public/resources/mesa-2.JPEG"/>

        <h2>what to expect</h2>
        <div className="content-background-colour">
          <p className="padding-top-40px service-text">Healing differs from person to person. However, it’s common for people to report experiencing some of the following during a healing:</p>
          <ul className="no-margin-bottom">
            <li>Relaxation, sleepiness, feelings of calm</li>
            <li>Soothing of stress and tension</li>
            <li>Emotional release</li>
            <li>Heat or coolness</li>
            <li>Tingling, pins & needles, or goosebumps</li>
            <li>Feelings of vibrational buzzing or electric currents in the body</li>
            <li>Visions, imagery, colours, hearing inner voices & guidance</li>
            <li>Among other effects</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="service-text padding-bottom-80px">Most effects will ground shortly after the session. However, the healing will be working within you in the days following so it’s advised to take good care of your mind & body and to pay attention to your dreams in this time to best integrate it.</p>

          <p className="service-text"><i>"The healing itself was very powerful and profound, I am still integrating the experience now. Bradley told me about the visions and energies he felt during the healing and they all matched with things I had been previously told or visions and inuitions I had. Following the healing I had very vivid and profound dreams which shed light on a lot of difficult issues my life, they also directly correlated with Bradley's visions and the two together have provided deep insight for me.</i></p>
          <p className="service-text padding-bottom-20px"><i>An overall brilliant experience that I feel has shed clarity on my path, illuminated reasons for past difficulties as well as affirmed things I already knew. Bradley is a talented and very connected energy healer, I would recommend him to anyone looking for shamanic healing."</i></p>

          <p className="service-text review-header padding-top-60px"><strong>Really interesting and inspiring</strong></p>
          <p className="service-text padding-bottom-20px"><i>"I found Bradley to be incredibly helpful and warm. He explained everything in detail. I had distant healing which is something I have never had before so I really didnt know what to expect. My overall experience was really interesting and inspiring. It's something I'm now interested in exploring further. I feel Bradley is incredibly intuitive and I would happily work with him again and highly recommend him to others."</i></p>
